Configuration sample files
==========================

Here are some details about the configuration files.

You may want to copy those files manually, or use the `fab configure` command to do it automatically.

If you choose to do it manually, you will have to replace some variables in some configuration files before using them.

gbp.conf
--------

This file should go to `~/.gbp.conf`.

mini-dinstall.conf
------------------

This file should go to `~/.mini-dinstall.conf`.

Variables:

* `repository_path`: the path to the Debian repository.

dput.cf
-------

This file should go to `~/.dput.cf`.

* `incoming_path`: the path to the incoming directory.
