Linux packaging how-to
======================

This how-to explains the guidelines to follow to package freelan libraries on the different linux platforms.

Debian & Ubuntu
---------------

Debian & Ubuntu share the same packaging system. Check `debian/README.md` for instructions.

Red-Hat & Fedora
----------------

Currently, no particular packaging is done for Fedora or Red-Hat based platforms.

Sorry, but you are on your own (for now).
