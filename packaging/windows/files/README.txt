Thank you for installing Freelan !
==================================

Your freelan installation was successful. Congratulations !

Freelan runs as a Windows service transparently in the background. You can look
for it in the Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools >
Services menu.

There is currently no graphical user interface for freelan: Freelan will
automatically connect to the configured network when your computer starts and
will gracefully disconnect when it shuts down.

By default, the freelan configuration is incomplete and must be modified before
the service can start. See
https://github.com/freelan-developers/freelan-all/wiki for a complete guide
about how to do that.
