Linux packaging how-to
======================

This how-to explains the guidelines to follow to package freelan libraries on the different linux platforms.

Debian & Ubuntu
---------------

All projects contain branches dedicated to Debian and Ubuntu packaging.

To create the package for a specified project, just checkout the required target and type:

> git buildpackage

This requires the `git-buildpackage` package.

Red-Hat & Fedora
----------------

Currently, no particular packaging is done for Fedora or Red-Hat based platforms.

Sorry, but you are on your own (for now).
