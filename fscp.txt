Abstract

   The FreeLAN peer-to-peer virtual private network specification
   requires a fast and secure communication channel.
   
   The protocol is specialized into peer-to-peer applications and
   supports some well-known NAT traversal techniques.
   
1. Introduction
   
   The FreeLAN peer-to-peer virtual private network specification
   requires a fast and secure communication channel.
   
   The FSCP (FreeLAN Secure Channel Protocol) is designed to be secure
   and efficient, and tries to minimize the overhead. It is based over
   UDP [RFC768].

   The protocol supports packet loss but does not deal with packet
   reordering or duplication.

1.1. Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Format

   FSCP uses different message formats. The roles of these messages are
   described in a further section.

   Multi-bytes integer values MUST be written in network byte order.

2.1. Generic message format

   All messages start with a 4 bytes header whose layout is:

                  0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31 
                 +--------+--------+-----------------+
                 |version |  type  |      length     |
                 +--------+--------+-----------------+

   The version MUST be set to the currently used version of the FreeLAN
   Secure Channel Protocol. The current version described in this document
   is 1.

   The type field indicates the type of the message. Its possible values
   are listed in the next sections.
   
   The length field indicates the length of the message body.

2.2. HELLO message format

   A HELLO message is 4 bytes long and has the following format:

                  0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31 
                 +-----------------------------------+
                 |           unique_number           |
                 +-----------------------------------+
 
2.2.1. HELLO message type

   The type value of a HELLO message can be either:
   
     0x00: For a request HELLO message
     0x01: For a response HELLO message

2.2.2. HELLO message fields

   The unique_number field is a 4 bytes value chosen by the sender of a
   HELLO request message.

2.3. PRESENTATION message format

   A PRESENTATION message has the following format:

                  0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31 
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |     sig_len     |       sig       c
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |     enc_len     |       enc       |
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

2.3.1. PRESENTATION message type

   A PRESENTATION message has a type value of 0x02.

2.3.2. PRESENTATION message fields

   The sig_len field indicates the size of the sig field.

   The sig field is a DER-encoded X509 certificate used for message
   signature by the sender. This certificate SHOULD have the
   digitalSignature key usage set, as specified in [RFC2459]. In the
   next sections, its associated RSA key will be referred as PKS.

   The enc_len field indicates the size of the enc field.

   The end field is a DER-encoded X509 certificate used for key exchange
   by the sender. This certificate SHOULD have the keyEncipherment key
   usage set, as specified in [RFC2459]. In the next sections, its
   associated RSA key will be referred as PKE.

   If the same certificate is to be used for both usages, a sender MAY
   set enc_len to zero and leave enc empty. In this case, the
   certificate SHOULD have both digitalSignature and keyEncipherment key
   usage set, as specified in [RFC2459].

   The sig and enc certificate MUST have the exact same subjectName and
   issuerName. If they don't, the message MUST be ignored.

   A host MIGHT ignore any PRESENTATION message whose sig or enc field
   do not satisfy the key usage requirements.

2.4. SESSION_REQUEST message format

   A SESSION_REQUEST message has no body.

2.4.1. SESSION_REQUEST message type

   A SESSION_REQUEST message has a type value of 0x03.

2.5. SESSION message format

   A SESSION message has the following format:

                  0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31 
                 +-----------------------------------+
                 |          session_number           |
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |     sig_len     |       sig       |
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |     enc_len     |       enc       |
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |      iv_len     |        iv       |
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

   This header is not sent in clear-text. It is first ciphered using
   PKE+ of the target host, then the ciphertext is signed using the
   sender host PKS-.

   That is, a SESSION message sent over the wire has the following
   format:

                  0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31 
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |      ct_len     |        ct       |
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |     cts_len     |       cts       |
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

2.5.1. SESSION message type

   A SESSION message has a type value of 0x04.

2.5.2. SESSION message fields

   The session_number indicates the identifier of the session. Every
   session SHOULD have its own and unique session_number value.

   The sig_len field indicates the size of the sig field. In the current
   version of this protocol, this should be 32.

   The sig field is a sig_len bytes long secret key used for message
   signature. In the next sections, this key will be referred as KS.

   The enc_len field indicates the size of the sig field. In the current
   version of this protocol, this should be 32.

   The enc field is a enc_len bytes long secret key used for message
   cipherment. In the next sections, this key will be referred as KE.

   The iv_len field indicates the size of the iv field. In the current
   version of this protocol, this should be 16.

   The iv field is the base initialization-vector to use for the
   session.

   The ct_len field indicates the length of the ct field.
   
   The ct field is the ciphertext, generated using the PKE+ of the
   target host.

   The cts_len field indicates the length of the cts field.

   The cts field is the ciphertext signature, generated using the PKS-
   of the sender host.

   A host who receives a SESSION message MUST first check if the cts
   signature matches the sending host PKS+. If the signature does not
   match, the message MUST be ignored.

   Once the signature has been checked, the receiving host MUST then
   decipher the ct field, using its own PKE-. If the decipherment fails,
   the message MUST be ignored.

2.6. DATA message format
   
   A DATA message format has the following format:

                  0      7 8     15 16    23 24    31 
                 +-----------------------------------+
                 |              seq_num              |
                 +-----------------+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |    data_len     |      data       |
                 +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+
                 |                hmac               |
                 +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

2.6.1. DATA message type

   A DATA message has a type value of 0x05.

2.6.2. DATA message fields

   The seq_num field indicates the sequence number of the current
   message. Two different DATA messages belonging to the same session
   MUST have two different sequence numbers. The rules governing the
   sequence number are explained in a further section.

   The rules governing session numbers are detailled in a further
   section of this document.

   The data_len field indicates the size of the data field.

   The data field represents the data of the message, ciphered using the
   remote host session cipher key and initialization vector. The last 4
   bytes of the initialization vector MUST first be XORed with the
   current sequence number (seq_num), in NETWORK BYTE ORDER.

   The hmac field contains the SHA-256 HMAC of the whole DATA message
   header, excluding the field itself (that is, bytes from range [0,
   data_len + 6]), using the remote host session signature key.

   This field SHOULD be 32 bytes long.

   A host who receives a DATA message MUST first check if the hmac
   matches the message. If the HMAC doesn't match, the message MUST be
   ignored.

3. Algorithms

3.1. Message digest algorithm

   The used message digest algorithm is SHA-256.

3.2. Symmetric cipherment algorithm

   The used symmetric cipherment algorithm is AES-256.

3.3. Asymmetric cipherment/signature algorithm

   The used asymmetric cipherment/signature algorithm is RSA-2048.

4. Protocol

4.1. Saying "Hello"

   A host CAN test the protocol support of another host using a request
   HELLO message.

   A host who receives a request HELLO message MAY respond with a
   matching HELLO response message. The response message MUST have the
   same unique_number value.

   If a HELLO response is received that doesn't match with a recently
   send HELLO request, it MUST be ignored.

   The maximum amount of time to wait for a HELLO response is up to the
   implementor. A recommended value is 4 seconds.

   That is, the whole HELLO message functionality is OPTIONAL.

4.2. Presentation

   If two hosts want to communicate but don't "know" each other, they
   CAN send a PRESENTATION message to the remote host to inform them
   about their idendity.

   A host who receives a PRESENTATION message is free to ignore it if
   the presented certificates are not acceptable. Whether a certificate
   is acceptable or not is up to the host.

   A host MAY ignore any PRESENTATION message whose certificate does
   not match a previously sent certificate.

   That is, the whole PRESENTATION message functionality is OPTIONAL.

4.3. Sessions

   When a host wants to establish a session MUST send a SESSION_REQUEST
   message to the target host.

   If no previous session exists with the requesting host, the target
   host SHOULD generate new session parameters and reply with a SESSION
   message containing those parameters. The session_number of the new
   session MUST be greater than the previous session_number.

   If a host does not receive a response SESSION message after 3
   seconds, he SHOULD send another SESSION_REQUEST.

   If a host receives more than one request SESSION_REQUEST within 3
   seconds, he MAY only accept the first one and discard the others.

   If a session with the requesting host already exists and is not too
   old (more on that in the next sub-section), the target host MAY
   reply with the parameters from the current session.

4.3.1 Old sessions

   Every session has a limited lifespan. One host may send a maximum of
   2^32 blocks of data during a session. A block has a size of 16 bytes.
   
   A session is considered old when a host considers too much blocks
   were sent during it. A good value for this "too much" is 2^24 blocks.

   If a host receives a SESSION message with a session_number smaller
   than the last used session_number, it MUST discard the message.

4.4. DATA messages

   Once a host has the session parameters for a target host, he can
   start sending DATA messages to him.

   The sequence number of the first DATA message of a given session MUST
   be 0.

   The next sequence numbers depends on the amount of previously sent
   data.

   If the previously sent sequence number was X, and if C bytes were
   sent, the next sequence number MUST be at least X + ((C + 15) / 16).

   If a host receives a DATA message with a sequence number lower than
   or equal to a previously received sequence number, he MUST ignore it.
